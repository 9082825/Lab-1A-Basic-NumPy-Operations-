# Lab-1A-Basic-NumPy-Operations-
This is the first of multi part lab - Lab 1A: Basic NumPy Operations

The purpose of this lab is to practice how to use NumPy to create 2-D arrays and easily compute 
mathematical operations. NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source package. In this lab you will 
practice how to create arrays and use NumPy array operations. Use indexing and slicing for 2-D arrays. 
Find the shape of an array, reshape it and stack it horizontally and vertically, Use the NumPy Linear 
Algebra package to solve system of Linear Equations.
